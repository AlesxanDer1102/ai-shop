## 🌟 Overview

HiveFi is an innovative open-source project revolutionizing the Mantle DeFi landscape through AI-powered agent swarms. By employing a sophisticated multi-agent system, HiveFi streamlines and automates DeFi operations, offering users a seamless and efficient experience on Mantle. Its modular design ensures scalability and adaptability, empowering users to navigate the complexities of DeFi with ease and confidence.

You can find detailed information in our [technical specifications](docs/specs.md), [system overview](docs/overview.md), and [complete whitepaper](docs/whitepaper.md).

### Why Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)?

Our platform leverages a Multi-Agent System architecture where each agent specializes in specific tasks—from fetching metrics to executing trades—enabling modular, scalable, and efficient operations. This approach ensures:

- **🎯 Specialization**: Optimized performance through task-specific agents
- **📈 Scalability**: Easy addition of new agents and features
- **🛡️ Robustness**: Continued operation even if individual agents fail
- **⚡ Efficiency**: Parallel task execution for improved performance
- **🔄 Adaptability**: Seamless integration with new protocols and APIs

Learn more about our agent system in the [agents documentation](docs/agents.md).
